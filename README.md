# Skyrim Character Data - Visualization with D3.js

[This](https://jake-dame.github.io/skyrim-data-visualization/) is a zoomable circle-packing map of Skyrim characters by city, and some of their attributes.

Even seasoned players can learn some interesting things about some of the NPC base stats! And if you are familiar with the Cloud District, then... on second thought, never mind.

You can choose to redraw the map by:

- Health
- Magicka
- Stamina

and

- Aggression
- Class
- Race
- Skill
- Morality
